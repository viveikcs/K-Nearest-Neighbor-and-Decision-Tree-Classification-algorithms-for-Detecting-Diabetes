# K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree Classification algorithms for Detecting Diabetes

**DESCRIPTION**

Applying and analyzing the performance of two Machine Learning classification algorithms - K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms - in predicting likelihood of diabetes from a dataset containing contained 9 parameters (8 features, and 1 target variable) for a total of for 770 people.
